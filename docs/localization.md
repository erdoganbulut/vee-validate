# Localization

This plugin only comes with English messages to keep things small, but it was built with flexible message generation in mind.
The [English messages file](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate/blob/master/dist/locale/en.js) is an example on how you would structure those messages. Then you may want to update the validator dictionary, which should happen once in your app startup. Still, you may update them whenever you want at any point of your app, check the [dictionary](#attributes-dictionary) description below.

## Field Names

### using data-vv-as

Seeing 'first_name' in your error messages can't be very good for your user experience, this plugin offers a couple of solutions: You can use the `data-vv-as` attribute on your field and give it a better name for your users, it would look like this:

```html
  <input v-validate data-vv-rules="alpha|min:3" data-vv-as="First Name" name="first_name" type="text">
```

Now when any error message is generated for this input, it will use the `data-vv-as` value instead of the actual field name. While this is very useful for simple setups and displaying localized names, it is only ideal for a single-locale page. For multi-localized pages and more advanced usages you might want to check the [dictionary API](#using-the-dictionary-api).

### using the dictionary API

All validators have access to a simple dictionary that is shared between all of them, this dictionary contains localized error messages and attributes. If the validator finds a localized attribute name for that field, it will be used instead of the field name. Pretty much like `data-vv-as` but `data-vv-as` takes priority if both are found.

Here is a little code example on how you would add support for your localized messages and attributes.

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VeeValidate from 'vee-validate';
import messagesAr from './strings/validator/messages/ar.js';
import attributesAr from './strings/validator/attributes/ar.js';
import attributesEn from './strings/validator/attributes/en.js';

// Pass options to make all validators use the arabic language, also merge the english and arabic attributes with the internal dictionary.
Vue.use(VeeValidate, {
  locale: 'ar',
  dictionary: {
    en: { attributes: attributesEn },
    ar: { messages: messagesAr, attributes: attributesAr }
  }
});

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    // Some Data ...
  },
  methods {
    // Cool methods ...
  }
});
```

::: warning
Your localization Logic should happen at the entry point of your application as it should be only executed once.

## Localization API

The validator class offers a static `localize` method which is also available on the instances, which have three overloads:

```js
const dictionary = {
  en: {
    // attributes and messages
  },
  ar: {
    // attributes and messages
  }
};

Validator.localize('en'); // changes the locale

// Merges the English dictionary and sets the current locale to English.
Validator.localize('en', dictionary.en);

// Merges all defined languages in the dictionary but does not set the current locale.
Validator.localize(dictionary);
```

All validators' locales are shared, calling `localize` on any instance available within any component will change the locale for all validators.

```js
// Inside a component.
this.$validator.localize('ar');

import { Validator } from 'vee-validate';

// Also available on the prototype.
Validator.localize('ar');
```

You will get a warning if you set the locale to one that has not been merged in the dictionary yet, any messages generated will fallback to English.

A working example can be found [here](examples.md#locale-example)

## Localized Files

In the [`locale`](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate/tree/master/locale) directory of this plugin, is a collection of localized files. If you can't find your locale, you could help this plugin by contributing a localized version to the [repository](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate). It will be happily accepted.

You can import those locales like this:

```js
import ar from 'vee-validate/dist/locale/ar';
import VeeValidate, { Validator } from 'vee-validate';

// Localize takes the locale object as the second argument (optional) and merges it.
Validator.localize('ar', ar);

// Install the Plugin.
Vue.use(VeeValidate);
```

You must note that the locale files exports the following object structure:

```js
export default {
  name: '{locale}',
  messages: {
    // ...
  }
};
```

Also note that if imported via script tags, they will be automatically installed if `VeeValidate` is available globally.

## Async Localization

Loading every locale in your app bundle is not very friendly for your user's bandwidth, especially since only one locale will be used. With a little bit of [Webpack `import()` magic](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports) we can get an async localization setup easily:

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import { Validator } from 'vee-validate';

Vue.mixin({
  localize (localeName) {
    // localize your app here, like i18n plugin.
    // asynchonously load the locale file then localize the validator with it.
    import(`./path/to/vee-validate-locales/${localeName}`).then(locale => {
      Validator.localize(localeName, locale);
    });
  }
});

```
